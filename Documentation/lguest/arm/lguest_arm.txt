ARM Lguest is designed to be a hypervisor for the ARM Linux kernel,
for Linux developers and users to experiment with virtualization with the
minimum of complexity.  Nonetheless, it has only been tested on Omap3530 
by now. 

NOTE:
If you want to run ARM Lguest on ARM chips which are not ARMv7, 
before building the kernel, you should modify 
linux/arch/arm/mach-armlguest/driver/arm/page_table_arm.h, 
linux/arch/arm/mach-armlguest/driver/arm/switcher-head.S and 
linux/arch/arm/mach-armlguest/kernel/proc-lguest.S 
by replacing "#ifdef CONFIG_CPU_V7" with "#if 1". But I am not sure
whether it can work on other ARM chips or not.
 



Building Kernel For Lguest:
- You should issue "make ulgImage" to compile Linux Kernel.
  ulgImage is uboot header(64 bytes) + Image(uncompressed image).
  At present, uImage (uboot header(64 bytes) +  zImage) cannot 
  be as the Guest. 

NOTE:
	ulgImage MUST NOT BE larger than 4M.
    (The Guest Kernel cannot boot when ulgImage is larger than 4M in my
     Development Board.)	
	

Running Lguest:

- The easiest way to run lguest is to use same kernel as guest and host.

  You will need to configure your kernel with the following options:

  "System Type":
     "ARM Lguest guest support" = Y 	
     "ARM Linux hypervisor example code = M/Y
     (CONFIG_ARM_LGUEST_GUEST=y ARM_LGUEST_GUEST=m)
     	

  "Device Drivers":
     "Block devices"
        "Virtio block driver (EXPERIMENTAL)" = Y

     "Network device support"
        "Universal TUN/TAP device driver support" = Y
        "Virtio network driver (EXPERIMENTAL)" = Y
           (CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK=y, CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET=y and CONFIG_TUN=y)


- A tool called "lguest" is available in this directory: type "make"
  to build it.  If you didn't build your kernel in-tree, use "make
  O=<builddir>".

- Create or find a root disk image.  

  Make sure that you install a getty on /dev/hvc0 if you want to log in on the
  console!

- "modprobe lg" if you built it as a module.

- Run an lguest as root:

   Documentation/lguest/arm/lguest 64 ulgImage --block=rootfile root=/dev/vda    

   Explanation:
    64: the amount of memory to use, in MB.

    ulgImage: please see "Building Kernel For Lguest" above. 

    --block=rootfile: a file or block device which becomes /dev/vda
       inside the guest.

    root=/dev/vda: this (and anything else on the command line) are
       kernel boot parameters.


- I have not tested "tunnet" on my ARM Board. 

Good luck!
